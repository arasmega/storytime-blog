Let me paint you a picture. It's 6 PM. You're trying to cook dinner while simultaneously preventing your three-year-old from using the cat as a stepping stool. You hand over the iPad with some "educational" app—the one with the friendly cartoon characters that promises to teach letters and numbers. Peace, finally.

Thirty minutes later, you announce dinner is ready. And that's when your sweet angel transforms into a tiny, rage-filled demon. Screaming. Tears. Maybe some thrown objects. You'd think you just confiscated their kidney, not a piece of glass and metal.

Here's the thing: it's not bad parenting. It's not even a "spoiled" child. It's neuroscience. That app? It's been deliberately designed to hijack your kid's developing brain using the same psychological tricks that make adults lose their life savings at casinos.
