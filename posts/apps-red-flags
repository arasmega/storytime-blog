So many apps for kids. But which one is bad and good for your kids? Here I list what to look for in kids app.

## Red Flags
- Ads (even "age-appropriate" ads teach consumerism to kids who can't distinguish advertising from content)
- In-app purchases (designed to exploit lack of impulse control)
- Autoplay features (removes natural stopping points)
- Character licensing from popular shows (leverages emotional attachment)
- Social features like likes, followers, or comments (creates FOMO in preschoolers, which is just... no)
- Fast-paced scene changes (overstimulates and prevents processing)
- Loud, jarring sounds (keeps arousal level high)

## Green Flags
- Encourage parent involvement
- Have natural stopping points (finite levels, clear endings to activities)
- Are slow-paced with time to process what's happening
- Teach cause-and-effect rather than just random responses
- Encourage offline activities ("Now go find something red in your house!")
- Don't send notifications (your three-year-old doesn't need push notifications)
