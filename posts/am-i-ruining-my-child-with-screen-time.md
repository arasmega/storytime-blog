# Am I ruining my child with screen time?

Here's the truth: **You're not the problem. The apps are.**

Most kids' apps are designed the same way slot machines are - to keep your child hooked, overstimulated, and asking for "just one more." That's why it feels impossible to say no. That's why you feel guilty every time you hand over the device.

It's not a parenting failure. It's a design problem.

## So how do I know which apps are harmful?

Here are the red flags that make apps addictive and overstimulating:

- **Autoplay features** - Removes natural stopping points, making it nearly impossible for kids to stop on their own
- **Fast-paced scene changes** - Overstimulates young brains and prevents them from processing what they're seeing
- **Loud, jarring sounds** - Keeps their arousal level high, leading to hyperactivity and meltdowns
- **Ads** - Teaches consumerism to kids who can't tell the difference between content and advertising

If the app your child uses has even one of these, you're dealing with design choices that work against you - and against your child's natural development.

## How is Storytime different?

Instead of red flags, we built Storytime with green flags:

- Natural stopping points - Our activities don't have start and ending. Kida can play and stop anywhere they want. There are no points to lose, no levels to restart.
- Slow-paced with time to process - Calm design that respects how young children actually think and learn
- Calm, gentle sounds - Soothing audio that doesn't overstimulate
- No ads - Zero commercial content, no manipulation, nothing to buy
- 
Storytime isn't just "better" - it's built differently from the ground up. It's a digital playground for creativity, not a system designed to capture attention at any cost.

## But how do I know it actually works?

You'll know in the first session.

The real test isn't what we tell you, it's what you notice with your own child.

**Watch what happens when you ask them to stop.**

With typical apps: Tantrums. Begging for "five more minutes." That sinking feeling in your stomach.

With Storytime: They stop. Maybe not instantly, but without the meltdown. Without the fight.

That's when you'll know the design is different. That's when the guilt lifts.

Some parents even say it's "boring" - and honestly? That's the highest compliment we get. It means we're not using tricks to hijack your child's attention.

## What if I forget to cancel?

You won't need to worry about that.

Our trial **ends automatically after 7 days.** There's nothing to cancel, no reminder to set, no credit card charged unless you decide to continue.

If Storytime works for your family, you can start a subscription right away:
- **RM9.90/month** 
- **RM99/year** (save over 15%)

If it doesn't work? The trial just ends. No hassle, no follow-up, no guilt.

## Why start today?

Because today could be the last day you feel guilty about screen time.

Tomorrow's screen time could look different. The peaceful transition you've been hoping for? You could see it tonight.

Every thoughtful parent deserves screen time they can feel proud of. The question isn't whether your child needs better apps - you already know they do.

The only question is: Why wait to find out if this works?
